# Mortar-Fire-Direction-Computer

The Mortar Fire Direction Computer was a handheld, ruggedised and weatherproof device issued to British Army 81mm mortar platoons in the early 1980s.

It was a software app (loaded via physical ROM modules/cartridges) running on an HP-41C programmable pocket calculator.

This is a virtualisation and visualisation of that device.
