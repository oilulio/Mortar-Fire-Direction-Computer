<h1>A virtualisation and visualisation of how apps used to be, back-in-the-day (40 years ago)</h1>

<p>The <a href="https://www.maszengrange.com/" target="_blank">Zengrange</a> Morzen <a href="http://www.hpcc.org/calculators/Morzen_Gunzen.pdf" target="_blank">
Mortar Fire Direction Computer</a> was a handheld, ruggedised and weatherproof device issued
to British Army <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/81_mm_mortar#/media/File:81mm_L16_mortier.jpg" target="_blank">81mm mortar</a> platoons in the early 1980s.
It was a software app (loaded via physical ROM modules/cartridges)
running on an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP-41C" target="_blank">HP-41C</a> programmable pocket calculator.</p>

<p>Meanwhile this was the calculator that NASA were using to do 
<a href="https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/calculator-hand-held-hp-41/nasm_A19890003000" target="_blank">calculations
on the space shuttle</a>, including as the back-up during re-entry while it was cut off from the ground</p>

<p>The MFDC functionality included the ability to program-in multiple preplanned mortar firing positions ("Mortar Lines", MLs) (grid and elevation);
program multiple pre-planned target locations (grid, elevation); and to calculate required mortar settings (bearing, elevation, charge) to
attack targets from a given mortar location, taking account of temperature and predicting time of flight.  It could 
also calculate shots based on target bearing and range, rather than grids.</p>

<p>It could run a countdown to a given <a href="https://history.army.mil/html/faq/ddayhhour.html" target="_blank">H-hour</a>,
a countup after H-hour, and a countdown from mortar launch to splash.</p>

<p>And it can do <a href="https://www.nwcg.gov/course/ffm/location/69-resection" target="_blank">resection</a>,
whereby when you have identified a few landmarks on the map and taken their bearings, it will
calculate your own grid location.</p>
 
<p>It used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourteen-segment_display" target="_blank">14-segment</a> LCD displays 
meaning it <span class="calctext">COULD DISPLAY TEXT, NUMBERS AND CHARACTERS :-?</span></p>

<p>And it could probably do other things I have yet to find out - it has a lot of buttons.</p>

<p>There was a similar device for Artillery, up to and including the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MGM-52_Lance#/media/File:MGM-52_Lance.jpg" target="_blank">Lance missile</a></p>

  <h3>Simulation Instructions.</h3> 

    <p>Turn on the device by clicking the ON/OFF button just under the left of the display</p>
    <p>Not all functions are yet implemented.  Working buttons will be highlighted when the cursor passes over them.</p>
    <p>The device will briefly flash up the identity of the ROM modules present (<span class="calctext">MFDC2-MDP38 225A-2F4B10A L16-L15(4/2)</span>) and then
    display <span class="calctext">MK 4 NO ML</span> i.e. this is the Mark 4 version and no Mortar Line (location) has yet been set.</p>
    <p>Click the RESECT (Resection) button.  This must be preceded by the shift (Diamond) key as it is a shifted function.  Device will display:
    <span class="calctext">PT. 1 GRID?</span>i.e a request for the <a href="https://shavenraspberry.com/faq-items/more-about-6-8-figure-grid-references/" 
    target="_blank">6 or 8 figure grid</a> of the first reference point (a landmark that you
    can observe, and one for which you know its grid reference from a map.)  If RESECT displays 2, then the shift was not pressed - use RESET to return.</p>

    <p>Using the example on p.150 of <a href="https://ia600205.us.archive.org/19/items/firearms_Mortar_Firing_Data_Instruments_for_Calculating_B-GL-385-015PT-001/Mortar_Firing_Data_Instruments_for_Calculating_B-GL-385-015PT-001.pdf"
     target="_blank">
    instructions for a similar Canadian device</a> we enter 16013955 as the 8 figure grid and press RUN. The device responds 
    <span class="calctext">PT. 1 BRG?</span>requesting the bearing of Point 1 in mils (see p15 of 
    <a href="https://bootcampmilitaryfitnessinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Military-Map-Reading-v2.0-2010-12.pdf" target="_blank">
    military map reading</a> to explain mils). We enter 2870 as per the example, then RUN.  We repeat for point 2 (GRID 16245213 BRG 1575),
    but for Point 3 we simply press RUN.  Two points are enough to do a resection, although using a third could increase 
    accuracy and avoid errors.  After a few seconds saying <span class="calctext">WORKING</span> the devices responds with the location (intersection)  
    <span class="calctext">INT: 1183 5202</span> 
    which effectively matches the example (which however states the more accurate 10 figure reference 11822 52022).</p>

    <p>At this point selecting ML (another shifted function, and not to be confused with MLs) will have the device confirm this
    is now the <span class="calctext">ACTIVE ML: 00</span> and then ask <span class="calctext">CH TMP 21C?</span>.  
    This is asking to either change or confirm the default 21 degrees centigrade temperature.  Entering 18 RUN will reset to 18 degrees, 
    simply entering RUN will keep the current temperature.
    The display now reads <span class="calctext">ML 00 READY</span>.  We have set our own mortar location and the met. conditions.
    For some reason if we set a ML directly, rather than from a resection, it also asks for an elevation.  It may be an error that it 
    does not ask after a resection.</p>
    
    <p>Once a ML is set, using ML without the shift will show us its details, pressing RUN to page through all details.</p>

    <p>Now let us select a target.  Say it is at grid 1403 5207 (which is in fact half way to point 2) and elevation -20 metres.  
    Press GRID, and the device asks <span class="calctext">TGT GRID?</span>, respond 14035207 RUN.  It then
    asks <span class="calctext">TGT ALT.?</span> so respond 20 +/- RUN.
    The device says <span class="calctext">ML 00: HE/WPN</span> (apparently an High Explosive round as default) and then
    <span class="calctext">BG: 1577 CH: 4</span>.  As expected for something half way to Point 2, this is the same
    bearing as point 2.  CH appears to be the propellant charge to be used.  Pressing RUN again gets 
    <span class="calctext">EL: 1258 T:37</span>.  The mortar should therefore
    be set to an elevantion angle of 1258 mils, and the time of flight will be 37 seconds.  Selecting SHOT (at the moment the mortar is fired) will begin
    a countdown until the display says <span class="calctext">SPLASH</span>.  It returns to displaying the 
    mortar bearing and azimuth, which we could correct based on observed fall of shot.  However this functionality is not yet
    implemented in this demonstrator.</p>
    
    <p>Entering TGT instead of GRID will store a target in a similar manner, without following through with the shot.</p>
